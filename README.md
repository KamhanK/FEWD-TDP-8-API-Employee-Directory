**Skills Used:**

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Fetch API
- JSON
- Google Fonts
- Grid Layout
- Flexbox
- Mobile-First Responsive Web Design

**Project Description:**

For this project I created all of the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript from scratch. I used Grid Layout and Flexbox to layout and arrange all the items of the web page. I used mobile-first responsive web design. I used a Google font for all of the text of the website. I created a searchable API employee directory using the Fetch API and a random user generator. The generator, generated user images, employee names, email addresses, phone numbers, addresses, and date of births. I used the Fetch API to import all the user data and parse that data using JSON. This project used JavaScript asynchronous call back functions, functions, arrays, conditionals, loops and object iteration. I fulfilled the "exceeds expectations" requirements by implementing a JavaScript list search filter from an example from the w3schools website that lets you filter and search the directory based on name, I created an overlay and modal window that has detailed information about the employee and is browsable by clicking the arrow buttons, which lets you progress forward in the directory or progress backwards.

This project was designed according to the provided mockups.

**Exceeds Expectations Requirements:**

Add a way to filter the directory by name. To do this, youâ€™ll need to request a random user nationality that will only return data in the English alphabet. Note: you don't have to rely on the API to return search results. You'll need to write functionality that filters result once they already on the page.

Add a way to move back and forth between employee detail windows when the modal window is open.

**Grade Received:**

Exceeds Expectations
